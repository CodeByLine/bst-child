/*
Theme Name:   BST Child
Template:     bst-master
Version:      1.0
Text Domain:  bst-child
*/

/*
NOTES:
======

(1.) You can't put your styles in this file (style.css). Put them in css/bst-child.css

(2.) Since downloads of BST from GitHub will be in a folder named 'bst-master', 
therefore in the CSS comment header above I have put 'Template: bst-master'. 
If you rename the BST root folder, you must make the same change to the 
Template: line above

(3.) There is a 'test' style rule in css/bst-child.css - if this child theme is 
working, your webpage <body> will turn GREEN. This will indicate that the child theme 
(and hence the parent theme) is installed correctly. 

Delete the test style rule when you no longer need it!
